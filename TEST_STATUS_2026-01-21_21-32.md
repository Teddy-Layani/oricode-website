## ⚠️ Current Test: 500 Error

**Session**: `ZCL_BM_LEARNING_S4D401_1748023680`
**Status**: ❌ 500 Internal Server Error
**Details**:
- Started at 21:32:03
- Chunk 1/6 stored (19,615 chars)
- Chunk 2/6 stored (9,312 chars)
- Error occurred after chunk 2

## Possible Causes

### 1. Anthropic API Issue
**Symptoms**: 500 error during AI processing
**Solution**: Retry the request

### 2. Railway Temporary Issue
**Symptoms**: 500 error intermittently
**Solution**: Wait 1-2 minutes, retry

### 3. Code-Specific Issue
**Symptoms**: Specific code triggers error
**Solution**: Check what modification was requested

### 4. Token Limit Hit
**Symptoms**: Error after several chunks
**Solution**: System prompt might still be too large

## Recommendation

**Try again with the same request**

If it works → Transient issue (Railway/Anthropic)
If it fails again → Code-specific or systematic issue

---

## What We Know Works ✅

1. **Chunking**: 8 chunks, 67K chars deployed successfully
2. **Structure**: Last chunk included `ENDCLASS.`
3. **Session Management**: Unique session IDs working
4. **Deployment**: Smart retry succeeded
5. **Cleanup**: Session cleaned up after deployment

**Overall**: The fixes are working! The 500 error is likely transient.

**Next**: Retry the same request to confirm it's transient
